Interactive Power BI Dashboard & COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Pandas (Python) and PostgreSQL, ensuring accuracy and efficiency for advanced querying and reporting.

# Features

Power BI Dashboard for visual insights:

Daily, weekly, and cumulative trends of cases and deaths

Country/state-level drill-down analysis

Comparative insights using dynamic filters

Data Cleaning using Pandas:

Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent formats

Data aggregation for trend analysis

PostgreSQL Database Integration:

Efficient storage of structured datasets

Advanced SQL queries for extracting meaningful insights

Scalable & Reproducible Workflow:

Fully automated ETL process

Clean separation between raw, processed, and analytical datasets

Tech Stack

Power BI → Interactive dashboard creation
